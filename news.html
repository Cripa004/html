    <p>The RMS Titanic, one of three Olympic-class ocean liners built around the turn of the century, was marketed before her maiden voyage as the “unsinkable ship.” She was built using the latest technologies, including steel rivets, which were more durable than their iron counterparts. People from all walks of life – poor immigrants to the rich and famous elite – bought tickets for the luxury ship’s maiden voyage. Some were headed for a new life in America. Others were returning home from business. Others were seeking a fun, maritime vacation.</p>

Take a look at these rare Titanic photos, and try not to shiver as you think of what it must have been like that fateful night. </div>
